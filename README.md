# 📱 Project: Megaline Plan Recommendation Model

## 🎯 Project Objective  
The mobile operator **Megaline** wants to encourage customers to switch from outdated plans to one of their new offerings: **Smart** or **Ultra**.  
This project aims to develop a supervised classification model that can predict which plan best suits each customer based on their behavior.

---

## ✅ Results Achieved  
- Analyzed a dataset with customer usage behavior: number of calls, messages, minutes and MB used  
- Identified data types and performed data cleaning (type conversions)  
- Verified class balance between Ultra and Smart plans  
- Trained and compared three models:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **Random Forest**  
- Tuned hyperparameters for the best model using validation sets  
- Final accuracy on the test set exceeded the 0.75 threshold defined by the business requirement

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy  
- **Techniques applied:**
  - Data preprocessing and type optimization
  - Model training and validation
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Accuracy evaluation on test data

---

## 🚀 Skills Developed  
- Transformation of business goals into a classification task  
- Evaluation and tuning of multiple supervised learning algorithms  
- Understanding of class balance and its effect on performance  
- Interpretation of model outputs and performance metrics  
- Structuring of clean and replicable data science projects

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements  
- Deploy the model as part of a recommendation engine or API  
- Include additional user behavior metrics (e.g., churn history, location)  
- Train on a larger time-series dataset to consider monthly usage trends  
- Evaluate with additional metrics such as precision, recall and F1-score
